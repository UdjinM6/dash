## Updated RPCs

- The `getblock` RPC command now supports verbose level 3 containing transaction inputs
  `prevout` information.  The existing `/rest/block/` REST endpoint is modified to contain
  this information too. Every `vin` field will contain an additional `prevout` subfield
  describing the spent output. `prevout` contains the following keys:
  - `generated` - true if the spent coins was a coinbase.
  - `height`
  - `value`
  - `scriptPubKey`
