Wallet
------

- `receivedby` RPCs now include coinbase transactions. Previously, the
  following wallet RPCs excluded coinbase transactions: `getreceivedbyaddress`,
  `getreceivedbylabel`, `listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`. This
  release changes this behaviour and returns results accounting for received
  coins from coinbase outputs. The previous behaviour can be restored using the
  configuration `-deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase`, but may be removed in a
  future release. (#6601)

- A new option in the same `receivedby` RPCs, `include_immature_coinbase`
  (default=`false`), determines whether to account for immature coinbase
  transactions. Immature coinbase transactions are coinbase transactions that
  have 100 or fewer confirmations, and are not spendable. (#6601)
